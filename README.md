plague-UK-1665
==============

Recent analysis, based on time series analysis of historic and recent records of plague epidemics, have identified 
significant discrepancies
between between the characteristics of epidemics that we have so far been attributing to plague. For example, in 
[this paper][1] Mark Welford and Brian Bossak show that the seasonal peaks of mortality of pre-1347, medieval Black
Death and present laboratory-confirmed cases differ significantly. Have we been wrong in attributing the Black Death
epidemic to bubonic and pneumonic plague? 

This question remains open, and we are simply going to illustrate here how mechanistic models could be used to
provide further insight into the characteristic of present and historic epidemics. We will be working on two time
series of the 1665 epidemic in the UK, each indicating the monthly number of deaths caused by plague in London
and Eyam. Contrasting these two cases is interesting due to the population difference between London (460000 inhabitants)
and Eyam (350 inhabitants).
